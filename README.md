# Equilateral Triangle Heat Equation Solver

This MATLAB script solves the steady-state heat equation for an equilateral triangle with user-defined side length and heat source.

## Features
- Flexible input for side length and heat source value.
- Solves the heat equation using finite element analysis.
- Visualizes the temperature distribution using contour and heat maps.

This project provides a MATLAB implementation of the steady-state heat equation solver for an equilateral triangle. The solver uses the finite element method (FEM) provided by MATLAB's PDE Toolbox to compute the temperature distribution within the triangle. The script allows users to define key parameters, such as the side length of the triangle and the heat source value, making it flexible and suitable for educational and research purposes.
