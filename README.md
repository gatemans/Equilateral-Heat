# Equilateral Triangle Heat Equation Solver

This project provides a MATLAB implementation of the steady-state heat equation solver for an equilateral triangle. The solver uses the finite element method (FEM) provided by MATLAB's PDE Toolbox to compute the temperature distribution within the triangle. The script allows users to define key parameters, such as the side length of the triangle and the heat source value, making it flexible and suitable for educational and research purposes.

## Features
- Custom Geometry: Automatically calculates the vertices of an equilateral triangle based on the user-specified side length.
- Steady-State Heat Equation: Solves the equation ∇²T + q = 0, where q is the heat source.
- Boundary Conditions: Allows fixed temperature values on each edge of the triangle.
- Visualization: Generates a contour plot and heat map of the temperature distribution.
- User-Friendly Input: Prompts users for side length and heat source value for easy customization.

## Applications
  Heat transfer analysis in triangular geometries.
  Understanding steady-state solutions in 2D domains.
  Educational tool for learning finite element methods and PDE solving in MATLAB.
